Detailed Description
--------------------



    The :class:`PySide.QtCore.QThreadPool` class manages a collection of QThreads.

    :class:`PySide.QtCore.QThreadPool` manages and recyles individual :class:`PySide.QtCore.QThread` objects to help reduce thread creation costs in programs that use threads. Each Qt application has one global :class:`PySide.QtCore.QThreadPool` object, which can be accessed by calling :meth:`PySide.QtCore.QThreadPool.globalInstance` .

    To use one of the :class:`PySide.QtCore.QThreadPool` threads, subclass :class:`PySide.QtCore.QRunnable` and implement the run() virtual function. Then create an object of that class and pass it to :meth:`QThreadPool.start()<PySide.QtCore.QThreadPool.start>` .

    ::

        class HelloWorldTask(QRunnable):
            def run(self):
                print "Hello world from thread", QThread.currentThread()

        hello = HelloWorldTask()
        # QThreadPool takes ownership and deletes 'hello' automatically
        QThreadPool.globalInstance().start(hello)


    :class:`PySide.QtCore.QThreadPool` deletes the :class:`PySide.QtCore.QRunnable` automatically by default. Use :meth:`QRunnable.setAutoDelete()<PySide.QtCore.QRunnable.setAutoDelete>` to change the auto-deletion flag.

    :class:`PySide.QtCore.QThreadPool` supports executing the same :class:`PySide.QtCore.QRunnable` more than once by calling tryStart(this) from within :meth:`QRunnable.run()<PySide.QtCore.QRunnable.run>` . If autoDelete is enabled the :class:`PySide.QtCore.QRunnable` will be deleted when the last thread exits the run function. Calling :meth:`PySide.QtCore.QThreadPool.start` multiple times with the same :class:`PySide.QtCore.QRunnable` when autoDelete is enabled creates a race condition and is not recommended.

    Threads that are unused for a certain amount of time will expire. The default expiry timeout is 30000 milliseconds (30 seconds). This can be changed using :meth:`PySide.QtCore.QThreadPool.setExpiryTimeout` . Setting a negative expiry timeout disables the expiry mechanism.

    Call :meth:`PySide.QtCore.QThreadPool.maxThreadCount` to query the maximum number of threads to be used. If needed, you can change the limit with :meth:`PySide.QtCore.QThreadPool.setMaxThreadCount` . The default :meth:`PySide.QtCore.QThreadPool.maxThreadCount` is :meth:`QThread.idealThreadCount()<PySide.QtCore.QThread.idealThreadCount>` . The :meth:`PySide.QtCore.QThreadPool.activeThreadCount` function returns the number of threads currently doing work.

    The :meth:`PySide.QtCore.QThreadPool.reserveThread` function reserves a thread for external use. Use :meth:`PySide.QtCore.QThreadPool.releaseThread` when your are done with the thread, so that it may be reused. Essentially, these functions temporarily increase or reduce the active thread count and are useful when implementing time-consuming operations that are not visible to the :class:`PySide.QtCore.QThreadPool` .

    Note that :class:`PySide.QtCore.QThreadPool` is a low-level class for managing threads, see :meth:`QtConcurrent.run()<PySide.QtCore.QtConcurrent.run>` or the other :ref:`Qt Concurrent<threads-qtconcurrent.html>` APIs for higher level alternatives.

.. class:: QThreadPool([parent=None])

    :param parent: :class:`PySide.QtCore.QObject`

    Constructs a thread pool with the given ``parent`` .


.. method:: PySide.QtCore.QThreadPool.activeThreadCount()


    :rtype: :class:`PySide.QtCore.int`




    This property represents the number of active threads in the thread pool.

    .. note::  It is possible for this function to return a value that is greater than :meth:`PySide.QtCore.QThreadPool.maxThreadCount` . See :meth:`PySide.QtCore.QThreadPool.reserveThread` for more details.

    .. seealso::  :meth:`PySide.QtCore.QThreadPool.reserveThread`  :meth:`PySide.QtCore.QThreadPool.releaseThread` 


.. method:: PySide.QtCore.QThreadPool.expiryTimeout()


    :rtype: :class:`PySide.QtCore.int`




    Threads that are unused for ``expiryTimeout`` milliseconds are considered to have expired and will exit. Such threads will be restarted as needed. The default ``expiryTimeout`` is 30000 milliseconds (30 seconds). If ``expiryTimeout`` is negative, newly created threads will not expire, e.g., they will not exit until the thread pool is destroyed.

    Note that setting ``expiryTimeout`` has no effect on already running threads. Only newly created threads will use the new ``expiryTimeout`` . We recommend setting the ``expiryTimeout`` immediately after creating the thread pool, but before calling :meth:`PySide.QtCore.QThreadPool.start` .



.. staticmethod:: PySide.QtCore.QThreadPool.globalInstance()


    :rtype: :class:`PySide.QtCore.QThreadPool`




    Returns the global :class:`PySide.QtCore.QThreadPool` instance.



.. method:: PySide.QtCore.QThreadPool.maxThreadCount()


    :rtype: :class:`PySide.QtCore.int`




    This property represents the maximum number of threads used by the thread pool.

    .. note::  The thread pool will always use at least 1 thread, even if ``maxThreadCount`` limit is zero or negative.

    The default ``maxThreadCount`` is :meth:`QThread.idealThreadCount()<PySide.QtCore.QThread.idealThreadCount>` .



.. method:: PySide.QtCore.QThreadPool.releaseThread()






    Releases a thread previously reserved by a call to :meth:`PySide.QtCore.QThreadPool.reserveThread` .

    .. note::  Calling this function without previously reserving a thread temporarily increases :meth:`PySide.QtCore.QThreadPool.maxThreadCount` . This is useful when a thread goes to sleep waiting for more work, allowing other threads to continue. Be sure to call :meth:`PySide.QtCore.QThreadPool.reserveThread` when done waiting, so that the thread pool can correctly maintain the :meth:`PySide.QtCore.QThreadPool.activeThreadCount` .

    .. seealso::  :meth:`PySide.QtCore.QThreadPool.reserveThread` 


.. method:: PySide.QtCore.QThreadPool.reserveThread()






    Reserves one thread, disregarding :meth:`PySide.QtCore.QThreadPool.activeThreadCount` and :meth:`PySide.QtCore.QThreadPool.maxThreadCount` .

    Once you are done with the thread, call :meth:`PySide.QtCore.QThreadPool.releaseThread` to allow it to be reused.

    .. note::  This function will always increase the number of active threads. This means that by using this function, it is possible for :meth:`PySide.QtCore.QThreadPool.activeThreadCount` to return a value greater than :meth:`PySide.QtCore.QThreadPool.maxThreadCount` .

    .. seealso::  :meth:`PySide.QtCore.QThreadPool.releaseThread` 


.. method:: PySide.QtCore.QThreadPool.setExpiryTimeout(expiryTimeout)


    :param expiryTimeout: :class:`PySide.QtCore.int`




    Threads that are unused for ``expiryTimeout`` milliseconds are considered to have expired and will exit. Such threads will be restarted as needed. The default ``expiryTimeout`` is 30000 milliseconds (30 seconds). If ``expiryTimeout`` is negative, newly created threads will not expire, e.g., they will not exit until the thread pool is destroyed.

    Note that setting ``expiryTimeout`` has no effect on already running threads. Only newly created threads will use the new ``expiryTimeout`` . We recommend setting the ``expiryTimeout`` immediately after creating the thread pool, but before calling :meth:`PySide.QtCore.QThreadPool.start` .



.. method:: PySide.QtCore.QThreadPool.setMaxThreadCount(maxThreadCount)


    :param maxThreadCount: :class:`PySide.QtCore.int`




    This property represents the maximum number of threads used by the thread pool.

    .. note::  The thread pool will always use at least 1 thread, even if ``maxThreadCount`` limit is zero or negative.

    The default ``maxThreadCount`` is :meth:`QThread.idealThreadCount()<PySide.QtCore.QThread.idealThreadCount>` .



.. method:: PySide.QtCore.QThreadPool.start(runnable[, priority=0])


    :param runnable: :class:`PySide.QtCore.QRunnable`
    :param priority: :class:`PySide.QtCore.int`




    Reserves a thread and uses it to run ``runnable`` , unless this thread will make the current thread count exceed :meth:`PySide.QtCore.QThreadPool.maxThreadCount` . In that case, ``runnable`` is added to a run queue instead. The ``priority`` argument can be used to control the run queue's order of execution.

    Note that the thread pool takes ownership of the ``runnable`` if :meth:`runnable->autoDelete()<PySide.QtCore.QRunnable.autoDelete>` returns true, and the ``runnable`` will be deleted automatically by the thread pool after the :meth:`runnable->run()<PySide.QtCore.QRunnable.run>` returns. If :meth:`runnable->autoDelete()<PySide.QtCore.QRunnable.autoDelete>` returns false, ownership of ``runnable`` remains with the caller. Note that changing the auto-deletion on ``runnable`` after calling this functions results in undefined behavior.



.. method:: PySide.QtCore.QThreadPool.tryStart(runnable)


    :param runnable: :class:`PySide.QtCore.QRunnable`
    :rtype: :class:`PySide.QtCore.bool`




    Attempts to reserve a thread to run ``runnable`` .

    If no threads are available at the time of calling, then this function does nothing and returns false. Otherwise, ``runnable`` is run immediately using one available thread and this function returns true.

    Note that the thread pool takes ownership of the ``runnable`` if :meth:`runnable->autoDelete()<PySide.QtCore.QRunnable.autoDelete>` returns true, and the ``runnable`` will be deleted automatically by the thread pool after the :meth:`runnable->run()<PySide.QtCore.QRunnable.run>` returns. If :meth:`runnable->autoDelete()<PySide.QtCore.QRunnable.autoDelete>` returns false, ownership of ``runnable`` remains with the caller. Note that changing the auto-deletion on ``runnable`` after calling this function results in undefined behavior.



.. method:: PySide.QtCore.QThreadPool.waitForDone()






    Waits for each thread to exit and removes all threads from the thread pool.



.. method:: PySide.QtCore.QThreadPool.waitForDone(msecs)


    :param msecs: :class:`PySide.QtCore.int`
    :rtype: :class:`PySide.QtCore.bool`




    This function overloads :meth:`PySide.QtCore.QThreadPool.waitForDone` .

    Waits up to ``msecs`` milliseconds for all threads to exit and removes all threads from the thread pool. Returns true if all threads were removed; otherwise it returns false.
